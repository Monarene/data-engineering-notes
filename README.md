## Introduction

This repository contains the personal notes I took while studying the data engineering Nanodegree.

Please read with a pretty open mind, also do not mind that I used "=>" to denote definitions, they are one of my favorite notations for definition and other things.

## Order to take the notes

I advice that you study the notes in the following order

- Data Modelling DE-ND
- Cloud Data warehouses DE-ND
- Data Lakes with Spark DE-ND
- Data pipelines with Airflow DE-ND
